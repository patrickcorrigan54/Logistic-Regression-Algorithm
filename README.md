# Logistic-Regression-Algorithm
This is a homework assignment for a graduate computer science course I took at UConn entitled, "Introduction to Machine Learning". The final question on this homework requires me to write a logistic regression algorithm from scratch. This repository includes the submitted homework assignment, the questions assigned, and the datasets used for the homework.
